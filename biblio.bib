@article{Duffy2000,
abstract = {A novel technique has been developed to study the kinetics of the back reaction of electrons with I3- in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline cells. A solid-state switched operational amplifier feedback circuit controlling the cell is used to alternate open-circuit and short-circuit conditions. In the experiment, electrons are injected by the photoexcited dye during illumination at open circuit, and then the subsequent decay of the open- circuit photovoltage in the dark is recorded up to a given time, at which the cell is short-circuited abruptly. The electron charge extracted at short circuit is measured by a current amplifier and integrator device. The kinetics of electron decay at open circuit has been studied by varying the delay between interrupting the illumination and short-circuiting the cell. Analysis of the time dependence of the electron density has established that the decay process is second-order in the total electron concentration. This is consistent with a mechanism involving the formation of I2-• as an intermediate. The pseudo-second-order rate constant for the reaction of electrons with tri-iodide was found to be 1.9 × 10-17 cm3 s -1 for [I3-] ) 0.05Mat24 °C.},

abstract = {Organic-inorganic perovskites have shown promise as high-performance absorbers in solar cells, first as a coating on a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold and more recently as a solid layer in planar heterojunction architectures. Here, we report transient absorption and photoluminescence-quenching measurements to determine the electron-hole diffusion lengths, diffusion constants, and lifetimes in mixed halide (CH3NH3PbI(3-x)Cl(x)) and triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite absorbers. We found that the diffusion lengths are greater than 1 micrometer in the mixed halide perovskite, which is an order of magnitude greater than the absorption depth. In contrast, the triiodide absorber has electron-hole diffusion lengths of {\~{}}100 nanometers. These results justify the high efficiency of planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells and identify a critical parameter to optimize for future perovskite absorber development.},

abstract = {The most accurate value of total solar irradiance during the 2008 solar minimum period is 1360.8 ± 0.5 W m−2 according to measurements from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and a series of new radiometric laboratory tests. This value is significantly lower than the canonical value of 1365.4 ± 1.3 W m−2 established in the 1990s, which energy balance calculations and climate models currently use. Scattered light is a primary cause of the higher irradiance values measured by the earlier generation of solar radiometers in which the precision aperture defining the measured solar beam is located behind a larger, view-limiting aperture. In the TIM, the opposite order of these apertures precludes this spurious signal by limiting the light entering the instrument. We assess the accuracy and stability of irradiance measurements made since 1978 and the implications of instrument uncertainties and instabilities for climate research in comparison with the new TIM data. TIM's lower solar irradiance value is not a change in the Sun's output, whose variations it detects with stability comparable or superior to prior measurements; instead, its significance is in advancing the capability of monitoring solar irradiance variations on climate-relevant time scales and in improving estimates of Earth energy balance, which the Sun initiates.},

abstract = {The ionic defects at the surfaces and grain boundaries of organic-inorganic halide perovskite films are detrimental to both the eeciency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, we show that quaternary ammonium halides can eeectively passivate ionic defects in several diierent types of hybrid perovskite with their negative-and positive-charged components. The eecient defect passivation reduces the charge trap density and elongates the carrier recombination lifetime, which is supported by density-function-theory calculation. The defect passivation reduces the open-circuit-voltage deficit of the p-in -structured device to 0.39 V, and boosts the eeciency to a certified value of 20.59 ± 0.45{\%}. Moreover, the defect healing also significantly enhances the stability of films in ambient conditions. Our findings provide an avenue for defect passivation to further improve both the eeciency and stability of solar cells.},

abstract = {We have isolated and characterized a second [Fe]-hydro- genase gene fromthegreenalga,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The HydA2 gene encodes a protein of 505 amino acids that is 74{\%} similar and 68{\%} identical to the known HydA1 hydrogenase from C. reinhardtii. HydA2 contains all the conserved residues and motifs found in the catalytic core of the family of [Fe]-hydrogenases.We demonstrate that both the HydA1 and the HydA2 transcripts are expressed upon anaerobic induction, achieved either by neutral gas purging or by sulfur deprivation of the cultures. Furthermore, the expression levels of both transcripts are regulated (in some casesdifferently)byincubation conditions, suchas thelength of anaerobiosis, the readdition ofO2, the presence of acetate, and/or the absence of nutrients such as sulfate during growth.Antibodies specific forHydA2 recognized a protein of about 49 kDa in extracts from anaerobically induced C. reinhardtii cells, strongly suggesting that HydA2 encodes for an expressed protein. Homology-based 3D modeling of theHydA2 hydrogenase shows that its catalytic sitemodels well to the known structure of Clostridium pasteurianum CpI, including the H2-gas channel. The major differences between HydA1, HydA2 and CpI are the absence of the N-terminal Fe-S centers and the existence of extra sequences in the algal enzymes.Toour knowledge, thisworkrepresents the first systematic study of expression of two algal [Fe]- hydrogenases in the same organism.},

abstract = {Time-resolved, pulsed excitation methods are widely used to deduce optoelectronic properties of semiconductors, including now also Halide Perovskites (HaPs), especially transport properties. Howev-er, as yet no evaluation of their amenability and justification for the use of the results for the above-noted purposes has been reported. To check if we can learn from pulsed measurement results about steady-state phototransport properties, we show here that, although pulsed measurements can be useful to extract information on the recombination kinetics of HaPs, great care should be taken. One issue is that no changes in the material are induced during or as a result of the excitation, and another one concerns in how far pulsed excitation-derived data can be used to find relevant steady-state pa-rameters. To answer the latter question, we revisited pulsed excitation, and propose a novel way to compare between pulsed and steady state measurements at different excitation intensities. We per-formed steady-state photoconductivity and ambipolar diffusion length measurements, as well as pulsed TR-MC and TR-PL measurements as function of excitation intensity on the same samples of dif-ferent MAPbI3 thin films, and find good quasi-quantitative agreement between the results, explaining them with a generalized single level recombination model that describes the basic physics of photo-transport of HaP absorbers. Moreover, we find the first experimental manifestation of the boundaries between several effective recombination regimes that exist in HaPs, by analyzing their phototransport behavior as a function of excitation intensity.},

abstract = {Photoconductivity measurements of CH3NH3PbI3 deposited between two dielectric-protected Au electrodes show extremely slow response. The CH3NH3PbI3, bridging a gap of ?2000 nm, was subjected to a DC bias and cycles of 5 min illumination and varying dark duration. The approach to steady -state photocurrent lasted tens of seconds with a strong dependence on the dark duration preceding the illumination. On the basis of DFT calculations, we propose that under light + bias the methylammonium ions are freed to rotate and align along the electric field, thus modifying the structure of the inorganic scaffold. While ions alignment is expected to be fast, the adjustment of the inorganic scaffold seems to last seconds as reflected in the extremely slow photoconductivity response. We propose that under working conditions a modified, photostable, perovskite structure is formed, depending on the bias and illumination parameters. Our findings seem to clarify the origin of the well-known hysteresis in perovskite solar cells.},

abstract = {A comprehensive morphological study was used to elucidate chloride's role in CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3-x)Cl(x) film evolution on a conducting polymer, PEDOT:PSS. Complex ion equilibria and aggregation in solution, as well as the role they play in nucleation, are found to ultimately be responsible for the unique morphological diversity observed in perovskite films grown in the presence of the chloride ion. An intermediate phase that is generated upon deposition and initial annealing templates continued self-assembly in the case of CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3-x)Cl(x). In the absence of chloride, the film growth of CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) is directed by substrate interfacial energy. By employing the through-plane TEM analysis, we gain detailed insight into the unique crystallographic textures, grain structures, and elemental distributions across the breadth of films grown from precursor solutions with different chemistries. The lattice coherence seen in morphologies generated under the influence of chloride provides a physical rational for the enhancement in carrier diffusion length and lifetime.},

abstract = {We investigate methylammonium (MA) transport in MA lead iodide under illumination and show this, as in the dark, to be measurable but negligible when compared with the major carriers. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show constant linewidths as a function of temperature, indicating the absence of significant MA diffusion. 13C tracer-exchange experiments reveal two distinct diffusion processes, one attributed to bulk MA transport and the other most probably due to higher dimensional defects. The former process has a diffusion coefficient that is consistent with the upper limit extracted from NMR measurements. Derived bulk conductivities for MA cations are orders of magnitude below the experimental ionic conductivity, corroborating the picture of pure iodine transport under illumination, as it was previously experimentally shown only for the dark situation.},

We prove the eligibility of the two new dopants by characterizing their optical and electrochemical properties and give evidence that both of them can be used to oxidize the molecular hole-transporter spiro-MeOTAD. Finally, we fabricate high-performance solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells using a state-of-the-art metal-free organic sensitizer in order to elucidate the influence of the type of dopant on device performance.},

@article{ORegan2008,
abstract = {In order to increase the energy efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells beyond 10{\%}, an improved dye needs to be developed with greater light absorption in the red and near-IR. Many dyes have been tested for this purpose; however, no dye with significant absorption beyond 750 nm has functioned properly. We have examd. a series of ruthenium phthalocyanines, a dye class with large and tunable absorption in the red. For these dyes we observe a large redn. in the output voltage of the cells relative to the benchmark dye (N719). By examn. of photovoltage transients and charge d. measurements, we demonstrate that this redn. in voltage is caused by a 100-fold increase in the rate const. for recombination (iodine redn.) at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. N719, however, does not seem to catalyze this reaction. By examn. of the literature, we propose that catalysis of the recombination reaction may be occurring for many other classes of potentially useful dyes including porphyrins, coumarins, perylenes, cyanines, merocyanines, and azulene. This widespread ability of the dye to catalyze recombination has not been appreciated before. This finding has important implications for future work to improve the red response of dye sensitized photovoltaics. [on SciFinder(R)]},

@article{Aharon2014,
abstract = {The inorganic-organic perovskite is currently attracting a lot of attention due to its use as a light harvester in solar cells. The large absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility and good stability of organo-lead halide perovskites present good potential for their use as light harvesters in mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells. This work concentrated on a unique property of the lead halide perovskite, its function simultaneously as a light harvester and a hole conductor in the solar cell. A two-step deposition technique was used to optimize the perovskite deposition and to enhance the solar cell efficiency. It was revealed that the photovoltaic performance of the hole conductor free perovskite solar cell is strongly dependent on the depletion layer width which was created at the TiO2-CH3NH3PbI3 junction. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that there were no changes in the crystallographic structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite over time, which supports the high stability of these hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of the best cells reached 10.85{\%} with a fill factor of 68{\%}, a Voc of 0.84 V, and a Jsc of 19 mA cm(-2), the highest efficiency to date of a hole conductor free perovskite solar cell.},

We report a low-cost, solution-processable solar cell, based on a highly crystalline perovskite absorber with intense visible to near-infrared absorptivity, that has a power conversion efficiency of 10.9{\%} in a single-junction device under simulated full sunlight. This "meso-superstructured solar cell" exhibits exceptionally few fundamental energy losses; it can generate open-circuit photovoltages of more than 1.1 volts, despite the relatively narrow absorber band gap of 1.55 electron volts. The functionality arises from the use of mesoporous alumina as an inert scaffold that structures the absorber and forces electrons to reside in and be transported through the perovskite.},

A gold film was evaporated on top of the CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) as a back contact. Importantly, the CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) nanoparticles assume here simultaneously the roles of both light harvester and hole conductor, rendering superfluous the use of an additional hole transporting material. The simple mesoscopic CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3)/TiO(2) heterojunction solar cell shows impressive photovoltaic performance, with short-circuit photocurrent J(sc)= 16.1 mA/cm(2), open-circuit photovoltage V(oc) = 0.631 V, and a fill factor FF = 0.57, corresponding to a light to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.5{\%} under standard AM 1.5 solar light of 1000 W/m(2) intensity. At a lower light intensity of 100W/m(2), a PCE of 7.3{\%} was measured. The advent of such simple solution-processed mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells paves the way to realize low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.},

abstract = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies for highly efficient and cost-effective solar energy production. In only a few years, an unprecedented progression of preparation procedures and material compositions delivered lab-scale devices that have now reached record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 20{\%}, competing with most established solar cell materials such as silicon, CIGS, and CdTe. However, despite a large number of researchers currently involved in this topic, only a few groups in the world can reproduce {\textgreater}20{\%} efficiencies on a regular n–i–p architecture. In this work, we present detailed protocols for preparing PSCs in regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) architectures with ≥20{\%} PCE. We aim to provide a comprehensive, reproducible description of our device fabrication protocols. We encourage the practice of reporting detailed and transparent protocols that can be more easily reproduced by other laboratories. A better reporting sta...},

abstract = {By applying a multitude of experimental techniques including 1H, 14N, 207Pb NMR and 127I NMR/NQR, tracer diffusion, reaction cell and doping experiments, as well as stoichiometric variation, conductivity, and polarization experiments, iodine ions are unambiguously shown to be the mobile species in CH3NH3PbI3, with iodine vacancies shown to represent the mechanistic centers under equilibrium conditions. Pb2+ and CH3NH3+ ions do not significantly contribute to the long range transport (upper limits for their contributions are given), whereby the latter exhibit substantial local motion. The decisive electronic contribution to the mixed conductivity in the experimental window stems from electron holes. As holes can be associated with iodine orbitals, local variations of the iodine stoichiometry may be fast and enable light effects on ion transport.},

abstract = {Charge transport layers (CTLs) are key components of diffusion controlled perovskite solar cells, however, they can induce additional non-radiative recombination pathways which limit the open circuit voltage (V{\_}OC) of the cell. In order to realize the full thermodynamic potential of the perovskite absorber, both the electron and hole transport layer (ETL/HTL) need to be as selective as possible. By measuring the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of perovskite/CTL heterojunctions, we quantify the non-radiative interfacial recombination current for a wide range of commonly used CTLs, including various hole-transporting polymers, spiro-OMeTAD, metal oxides and fullerenes. We find that all studied CTLs limit the V{\_}OC by inducing an additional non-radiative recombination current that is significantly larger than the loss in the neat perovskite and that the least-selective interface sets the upper limit for the V{\_}OC of the device. The results also show that the V{\_}OC equals the internal QFLS in the absorber layer of (pin, nip) cells with selective CTLs and power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.4{\%}. However, in case of less selective CTLs, the V{\_}OC is substantially lower than the QFLS which indicates additional losses at the contacts and/or interfaces. The findings are corroborated by rigorous device simulations which outline several important considerations to maximize the V{\_}OC. This work shows that the real challenge to supress non-radiative recombination losses in perovskite cells on their way to the radiative limit lies in the suppression of carrier recombination at the perovskite/CTL interfaces.},

abstract = {Ion migration is seen as a primary stability concern of halide perovskite-based photovoltaic and optoelec-tronic devices. Here, we provide experimental studies of long-distance, reversible ion migration in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3) films. We use time-resolved scanning Kelvin probe microscopy on insulator-coated lateral electrodes to probe the dynamic redistribution of charged Frenkel defects over micrometer distances after application of an electric field. We combine these dynamic measurements with drift−diffusion simulations that yield self-consistent pictures of the sign, distribution, mobility, and activation energy of the associated, mobile Frenkel defects. This comprehensive approach is applied to study the impact of an organic cation on ionic mobility in metal halide perovskites, which we find to be significantly reduced in the case of FAPbI 3 films compared to MAPbI 3 films. ■ INTRODUCTION Rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies, currently exceeding 22{\%}, 1 combined with simple solution-based processing routes have placed metal halide perovskites in the spotlight of the present photovoltaic research. This promising class of semiconductor materials forms with an ABX 3 chemical formula, with methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , abbreviated as MAPbI 3) and formamidinium lead iodide (HC(NH 2) 2 PbI 3 , abbreviated as FAPbI 3) as two of the most commonly studied reference compounds. Despite their high efficiencies in photovoltaic devices, these materials can also exhibit a number of dynamic phenomena, such as slow response times and hysteresis effects, 2−5 which are often explained in the context of mobile ions and point defects at room temperature. As a result, the mobility of ions and defects is currently of great interest for perovskite-based solar cells. 2,6 Although considerable experimental evidence suggests that halide-related defects are the most mobile species in metal halide perovskites, 7,8 many questions about the ionic migration mechanism remain unanswered. Varying theoretical calculations predict either vacancy-dominated 3,9,10 or equivalent migration 11,12 of the associated Frenkel defects of halide vacancies and interstitials, with a strong dependency of activation barriers on crystal direction. 12,13 Furthermore, a local screening of moving ionic charge by coupled rotation of organic dipoles has been proposed to assist the migration of iodide in MAPbI 3. 14 The fact that the calculated values for diffusion coefficients span nearly 6 orders of magnitude (10 −6 to 10 −12 cm 2 /V s) 9,10,15 with associated activation energies that spread over 0.5 eV (0.1−0.6 eV), 3,9−13 highlights the need for experimental measurements of ionic mobilities. A variety of experimental, temperature-dependent techniques have been applied to evaluate the activation energy of mobile ions in metal halide perovskites, including current or voltage responses, 3,4,9,16−18 impedance spectroscopy, 17,19−21 conductivity , 22,23 and photoluminescence measurements. 24,25 However, many of these methods require illumination, which has been shown to have a major impact on ion migration, 22,23 or the fabrication of complete solar cell devices with different charge-injecting and-extracting layers. 3,4,9,16,17,19 These approaches, although powerful, can be complicated by extrinsic factors and do not always allow the direct examination of mobile ions. Considering the dynamics of mobile ions, significantly fewer experimental reports are available. Besides photoluminescence quenching experiments based on significant laser illumination, 26 experimental determination of the ionic diffusion coefficient has primarily been obtained by impedance spectroscopy, 19,21 which},

abstract = {Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) cells of the design FTO/sTiO2/mpTiO2/MAPI/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide, sTiO2 indicates solid-TiO2, and mpTiO2 is mesoporous TiO2, are studied using transient photovoltage (TPV), differential capacitance, charge extn., current interrupt, and chronophotoamperometry. We show that in mpTiO2/MAPI cells there are two kinds of extractable charge stored under operation: a capacitive electronic charge (∼0.2 $\mu$C/cm2) and another, larger charge (40 $\mu$C/cm2), possibly related to mobile ions. Transient photovoltage decays are strongly double exponential with two time consts. that differ by a factor of ∼5, independent of bias light intensity. The fast decay (∼1 $\mu$s at 1 sun) is assigned to the predominant charge recombination pathway in the cell. We examine and reject the possibility that the fast decay is due to ferroelec. relaxation or to the bulk photovoltaic effect. Like many MAPI solar cells, the studied cells show significant J-V hysteresis. Capacitance vs open circuit voltage (Voc) data indicate that the hysteresis involves a change in internal potential gradients, likely a shift in band offset at the TiO2/MAPI interface. The TPV results show that the Voc hysteresis is not due to a change in recombination rate const. Calcn. of recombination flux at Voc suggests that the hysteresis is also not due to an increase in charge sepn. efficiency and that charge generation is not a function of applied bias. We also show that the J-V hysteresis is not a light driven effect but is caused by exposure to elec. bias, light or dark. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The Al2O3-treated cells show improved voltages and fill factors but lower short-circuit currents. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements have been used to find the pseudo-first-order recombination rate constant (kpfo) and capacitance as a function of potential. Results show that kpfo is dependent on Voc with the same form as in TiO2/dye/electrolyte cells. The added Al2O3 layer acts as a ?tunnel barrier?, reducing the kpfo and thus increasing Voc. The decrease in kpfo also results in an increased fill factor. Capacitance vs voltage plots show the same curvature (?150 mV/decade) as found in TiO2/dye/electrolyte cells. The application of one Al2O3 layer does not cause a significant shift in the shape or position of the capacitance curve, indicating that changes in band offset play a lesser role in the observed Voc increase. Cells made with P25 TiO2 have, on average, 2.5 times slower recombination rate constants (longer lifetimes) than those made with colloidal TiO2.

abstract = {Ionic migration has been proposed as a possible cause of photovoltaic current-voltage hysteresis in hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, a major objection to this hypothesis is that hysteresis can be reduced by changing the interfacial contact materials, which are unlikely to significantly influence the behaviour of ionic defects within the perovskite phase. Here we use transient optoelectronic measurements, combined with device simulations, to show that the primary effects of ionic migration can in fact be observed both in devices with hysteresis, and with hysteresis free type contact materials. The data indicate that electric-field screening, consistent with ionic migration, is similar or identical in both high and low hysteresis CH3NH3PbI3 cells. Simulation of the transients shows that hysteresis requires the combination of both mobile ionic charge and recombination near the contacts. Passivating contact recombination results in higher photogenerated charge concentrations at forward bias which screen the ionic charge, reducing hysteresis.},

abstract = {Chemical bath deposition of TiO2 from TiCl4 is an often used treatment that improves the photocurrent from dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells. In this paper, charge density and kinetic data are used to show that the main effects of this treatment are an 80 mV downward shift in the TiO2 conduction band edge potential and a 20-fold decrease in the electron/electrolyte recombination rate constant. Together, these changes increase the quantum efficiency of charge separation at the interface, thus providing the observed increase in the photocurrent. The reduction in the recombination rate constant allows a greater concentration of electrons to accumulate at Voc, thus offsetting the Voc loss otherwise expected from the conduction band edge shift. Photocurrent transients and charge extraction data are used to show that the TiCl4 treatment has little effect on the transport of electrons at short circuit. The electron/electrolyte recombination rate constant at short circuit has been measured with the CCTPV (Constant Current Transient PhotoVoltage) technique. The results further confirm that any improvements in transport could not cause the beneficial effect of the TiCl4 treatment. Verification of the CCTPV technique is undertaken by comparison to transient absorption and by a model of the technique. Charge separation in dye-sensitized cells concerns two steps, charge injection and dye regeneration. Transient optical experiments to determine which process is improved by the TiCl4 treatment are discussed.},

abstract = {In Methyl Ammonium Lead Iodide (MAPI) perovskite solar cells, screening of the built-in field by mobile ions has been proposed as part of the cause of the large hysteresis observed in the current/voltage scans in many cells. We show that photocurrent transients measured immediately (e.g. 100 $\mu$s) after a voltage step can provide direct evidence that this field screening exists. Just after a step to forward bias, the photocurrent transients are reversed in sign (i.e. inverted), and the magnitude of the inverted transients can be used to find an upper bound on the width of the space charge layers adjacent to the electrodes. This in turn provides a lower bound on the mobile charge concentration, which we find to be ≳1 × 1017 cm−3. Using a new photocurrent transient experiment, we show that the space charge layer thickness remains approximately constant as a function of bias, as expected for mobile ions in a solid electrolyte. We also discuss additional characteristics of the inverted photocurrent transients that imply either an unusually stable deep trapping, or a photo effect on the mobile ion conductivity.},

abstract = {We report on a new metal halide perovskite photovoltaic cell that exhibits both very high solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiency and intense electroluminescence. We produce the perovskite films in a single step from a solution containing a mixture of FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 (where FA stands for formamidinium cations and MA stands for methylammonium cations). Using mesoporous TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD as electron- and hole-specific contacts, respectively, we fabricate perovskite solar cells that achieve a maximum power-conversion efficiency of 20.8{\%} for a PbI2/FAI molar ratio of 1.05 in the precursor solution. Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction data reveals that the excess PbI2 content incorporated into such a film is about 3 weight percent. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements show that the small excess of PbI2 suppresses nonradiative charge carrier recombination. This in turn augments the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency to values of about 0.5{\%}, a record for perovskite photovoltaics approaching that of the best silicon solar cells. Correspondingly, the open-circuit photovoltage reaches 1.18 V under AM 1.5 sunlight.},

We demonstrate highly efficient solar cells exhibiting 12.3{\%} in a power conversion efficiency of under standard AM 1.5, for the most efficient device, as a result of tunable composition for the light harvester in conjunction with a mesoporous TiO2 film and a hole conducting polymer. We believe that the works highlighted in this paper represent one step toward the realization of low-cost, high-efficiency, and long-term stability with colorful solar cells.},

abstract = {The ideality factor determined by measuring the open circuit voltage (VOC) as function of light intensity is often used as a means to identify the dominant recombination mechanism in solar cells. However, applying this Suns-VOC technique to perovskite cells is problematic since the VOC evolves with time in a way which depends on the previously applied bias (Vpre), the light intensity, and the device architecture/processing. Here we show that the dominant recombination mechanism in two structurally similar CH3NH3PbI3 devices containing either mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 layers can be identified from the signature of the transient ideality factor following application of a forward bias, Vpre, to the device in the dark. The transient ideality factor, is measured by monitoring the temporal evolution of VOC at different light intensities. The initial values of the transient ideality were consistent with corresponding photoluminescence vs intensity as well as electroluminescence vs current density measurements. Time-dependent simulations of the measurement on modelled devices, which include the effects of mobile ionic charge, show that Shockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination through deep traps at the charge collection interfaces is dominant in both devices. Using transient photovoltage measurements superimposed on the evolving VOC of bifacial devices we further show that the charge collection interface extends throughout the mesoporous TiO2 layer, consistent with a transient ideality signature corresponding to SRH recombination in the bulk of the film. This information could not be inferred from an ideality factor determined from only steady-state VOC values. The method we have developed will be useful for identifying performance bottlenecks in new variants of perovskite devices by comparison with the transient ideality signatures we have predicted for a range of possible recombination schemes.},

abstract = {How much energy could be generated if PV modules were installed on all of the suitable roof area in the nation? To answer this question, we first use GIS methods to process a lidar dataset and determine the amount of roof area that is suitable for PV deployment in 128 cities nationwide, containing 23{\%} of U.S. buildings, and provide PV-generation results for a subset of those cities. We then extend the insights from that analysis to the entire continental United States. We develop two statistical models--one for small buildings and one for medium and large buildings--and populate them with geographic variables that correlate with rooftop's suitability for PV. We simulate the productivity of PV installed on the suitable roof area, and present the technical potential of PV on both small buildings and medium/large buildings for every state in the continental US. Within the 128 cities covered by lidar data, 83{\%} of small buildings have a location suitable for a PV installation, but only 26{\%} of the total rooftop area of small buildings is suitable for development. The sheer number of buildings in this class, however, gives small buildings the greatest technical potential. Small building rooftops could accommodate 731 GW of PV capacity and generate 926 TWh/year of PV energy, approximately 65{\%} of rooftop PV's total technical potential. We conclude by summing the PV-generation results for all building sizes and therefore answering our original question, estimating that the total national technical potential of rooftop PV is 1,118 GW of installed capacity and 1,432 TWh of annual energy generation. This equates to 39{\%} of total national electric-sector sales.},

abstract = {Thin film lead halide perovskite cells, where the perovskite layer is deposited directly onto a flat titania blocking layer, have reached AM 1.5 efficiencies of over 15{\%},1 showing that the mesoporous scaffold used in early types of perovskite solar cells is not essential. We have used a variety of techniques to gain a better understanding of thin film perovskite cells prepared by a solution-based method. Twelve cells were studied, which showed AM 1.5 efficiencies of ≈ 11{\%}. The properties of the cells were investigated using impedance spectroscopy, intensity modulated photovoltage spec- troscopy (IMVS), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD). Despite the fact that all 12 cells were prepared at the same time under nominally identical conditions, their behavior fell into two distinct groups. Half the cells exhibited ideality factors of m≈2.5 and the other half showed ideality factors of m≈5. Impedance spectroscopy carried out under illumination at open circuit for a range of intensities showed that the cell capacitance was dominated by the geometric capacitance of the perovskite layer rather than the chemical or diffusion capacitance due to photogenerated carriers. The voltage dependence of the recombination resistance gave ideality factors similar to those derived from the intensity dependence of the open circuit voltage. The IMVS time constant was deter- mined by the product of the geometric capacitance and the recombination resistance. The two types of cell gave very dif- ferent OCVD responses. The cells with m≈2.5 showed a persistent photovoltage effect that was absent in the case of the cells with higher ideality factors. The IMPS responses provide evidence of minor efficiency losses by recombination under short},

abstract = {Abstract The physical origin of the open-circuit voltage in bulk heterojunction solar cells is still not well understood. While significant evidence exists to indicate that the open-circuit voltage is limited by the molecular orbital energies of the heterojunction components, it is clear that this picture is not sufficient to explain the significant variations which often occur between cells fabricated from the same heterojunction components. We present here an analysis of the variation in open-circuit voltage between 0.4–0.65 V observed for a range of P3HT/PCBM solar cells where device deposition conditions, electrode structure, active-layer thickness and device polarity are varied. The analysis quantifies non-geminate recombination losses of dissociated carriers in these cells, measured under device operating conditions. It is found that at open-circuit, losses due to non-geminate recombination are sufficiently large that other loss pathways may effectively be neglected. Variations in open-circuit voltage between different devices are shown to arise from differences in the rate coefficient for non-geminate recombination, and from differences in the charge densities in the photoactive layer of the device. The origin of these differences is discussed, particularly with regard to variations in film microstructure. By separately quantifying these differences in rate coefficient and charge density, and by application of a simple physical model based upon the assumption that open-circuit is reached when the flux of charge photogeneration is matched by the flux of non-geminate recombination, we are able to calculate correctly the open-circuit voltage for all the cells studied to within an accuracy of ±5 mV.},
