abstract = {Ion migration is seen as a primary stability concern of halide perovskite-based photovoltaic and optoelec-tronic devices. Here, we provide experimental studies of long-distance, reversible ion migration in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3) films. We use time-resolved scanning Kelvin probe microscopy on insulator-coated lateral electrodes to probe the dynamic redistribution of charged Frenkel defects over micrometer distances after application of an electric field. We combine these dynamic measurements with drift−diffusion simulations that yield self-consistent pictures of the sign, distribution, mobility, and activation energy of the associated, mobile Frenkel defects. This comprehensive approach is applied to study the impact of an organic cation on ionic mobility in metal halide perovskites, which we find to be significantly reduced in the case of FAPbI 3 films compared to MAPbI 3 films. ■ INTRODUCTION Rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies, currently exceeding 22{\%}, 1 combined with simple solution-based processing routes have placed metal halide perovskites in the spotlight of the present photovoltaic research. This promising class of semiconductor materials forms with an ABX 3 chemical formula, with methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , abbreviated as MAPbI 3) and formamidinium lead iodide (HC(NH 2) 2 PbI 3 , abbreviated as FAPbI 3) as two of the most commonly studied reference compounds. Despite their high efficiencies in photovoltaic devices, these materials can also exhibit a number of dynamic phenomena, such as slow response times and hysteresis effects, 2−5 which are often explained in the context of mobile ions and point defects at room temperature. As a result, the mobility of ions and defects is currently of great interest for perovskite-based solar cells. 2,6 Although considerable experimental evidence suggests that halide-related defects are the most mobile species in metal halide perovskites, 7,8 many questions about the ionic migration mechanism remain unanswered. Varying theoretical calculations predict either vacancy-dominated 3,9,10 or equivalent migration 11,12 of the associated Frenkel defects of halide vacancies and interstitials, with a strong dependency of activation barriers on crystal direction. 12,13 Furthermore, a local screening of moving ionic charge by coupled rotation of organic dipoles has been proposed to assist the migration of iodide in MAPbI 3. 14 The fact that the calculated values for diffusion coefficients span nearly 6 orders of magnitude (10 −6 to 10 −12 cm 2 /V s) 9,10,15 with associated activation energies that spread over 0.5 eV (0.1−0.6 eV), 3,9−13 highlights the need for experimental measurements of ionic mobilities. A variety of experimental, temperature-dependent techniques have been applied to evaluate the activation energy of mobile ions in metal halide perovskites, including current or voltage responses, 3,4,9,16−18 impedance spectroscopy, 17,19−21 conductivity , 22,23 and photoluminescence measurements. 24,25 However, many of these methods require illumination, which has been shown to have a major impact on ion migration, 22,23 or the fabrication of complete solar cell devices with different charge-injecting and-extracting layers. 3,4,9,16,17,19 These approaches, although powerful, can be complicated by extrinsic factors and do not always allow the direct examination of mobile ions. Considering the dynamics of mobile ions, significantly fewer experimental reports are available. Besides photoluminescence quenching experiments based on significant laser illumination, 26 experimental determination of the ionic diffusion coefficient has primarily been obtained by impedance spectroscopy, 19,21 which},

abstract = {Photoconductivity measurements of CH3NH3PbI3 deposited between two dielectric-protected Au electrodes show extremely slow response. The CH3NH3PbI3, bridging a gap of ?2000 nm, was subjected to a DC bias and cycles of 5 min illumination and varying dark duration. The approach to steady -state photocurrent lasted tens of seconds with a strong dependence on the dark duration preceding the illumination. On the basis of DFT calculations, we propose that under light + bias the methylammonium ions are freed to rotate and align along the electric field, thus modifying the structure of the inorganic scaffold. While ions alignment is expected to be fast, the adjustment of the inorganic scaffold seems to last seconds as reflected in the extremely slow photoconductivity response. We propose that under working conditions a modified, photostable, perovskite structure is formed, depending on the bias and illumination parameters. Our findings seem to clarify the origin of the well-known hysteresis in perovskite solar cells.},

abstract = {The ideality factor determined by measuring the open circuit voltage (VOC) as function of light intensity is often used as a means to identify the dominant recombination mechanism in solar cells. However, applying this Suns-VOC technique to perovskite cells is problematic since the VOC evolves with time in a way which depends on the previously applied bias (Vpre), the light intensity, and the device architecture/processing. Here we show that the dominant recombination mechanism in two structurally similar CH3NH3PbI3 devices containing either mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 layers can be identified from the signature of the transient ideality factor following application of a forward bias, Vpre, to the device in the dark. The transient ideality factor, is measured by monitoring the temporal evolution of VOC at different light intensities. The initial values of the transient ideality were consistent with corresponding photoluminescence vs intensity as well as electroluminescence vs current density measurements. Time-dependent simulations of the measurement on modelled devices, which include the effects of mobile ionic charge, show that Shockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination through deep traps at the charge collection interfaces is dominant in both devices. Using transient photovoltage measurements superimposed on the evolving VOC of bifacial devices we further show that the charge collection interface extends throughout the mesoporous TiO2 layer, consistent with a transient ideality signature corresponding to SRH recombination in the bulk of the film. This information could not be inferred from an ideality factor determined from only steady-state VOC values. The method we have developed will be useful for identifying performance bottlenecks in new variants of perovskite devices by comparison with the transient ideality signatures we have predicted for a range of possible recombination schemes.},

abstract = {Thin film lead halide perovskite cells, where the perovskite layer is deposited directly onto a flat titania blocking layer, have reached AM 1.5 efficiencies of over 15{\%},1 showing that the mesoporous scaffold used in early types of perovskite solar cells is not essential. We have used a variety of techniques to gain a better understanding of thin film perovskite cells prepared by a solution-based method. Twelve cells were studied, which showed AM 1.5 efficiencies of ≈ 11{\%}. The properties of the cells were investigated using impedance spectroscopy, intensity modulated photovoltage spec- troscopy (IMVS), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD). Despite the fact that all 12 cells were prepared at the same time under nominally identical conditions, their behavior fell into two distinct groups. Half the cells exhibited ideality factors of m≈2.5 and the other half showed ideality factors of m≈5. Impedance spectroscopy carried out under illumination at open circuit for a range of intensities showed that the cell capacitance was dominated by the geometric capacitance of the perovskite layer rather than the chemical or diffusion capacitance due to photogenerated carriers. The voltage dependence of the recombination resistance gave ideality factors similar to those derived from the intensity dependence of the open circuit voltage. The IMVS time constant was deter- mined by the product of the geometric capacitance and the recombination resistance. The two types of cell gave very dif- ferent OCVD responses. The cells with m≈2.5 showed a persistent photovoltage effect that was absent in the case of the cells with higher ideality factors. The IMPS responses provide evidence of minor efficiency losses by recombination under short},

abstract = {A novel technique has been developed to study the kinetics of the back reaction of electrons with I3- in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline cells. A solid-state switched operational amplifier feedback circuit controlling the cell is used to alternate open-circuit and short-circuit conditions. In the experiment, electrons are injected by the photoexcited dye during illumination at open circuit, and then the subsequent decay of the open- circuit photovoltage in the dark is recorded up to a given time, at which the cell is short-circuited abruptly. The electron charge extracted at short circuit is measured by a current amplifier and integrator device. The kinetics of electron decay at open circuit has been studied by varying the delay between interrupting the illumination and short-circuiting the cell. Analysis of the time dependence of the electron density has established that the decay process is second-order in the total electron concentration. This is consistent with a mechanism involving the formation of I2-• as an intermediate. The pseudo-second-order rate constant for the reaction of electrons with tri-iodide was found to be 1.9 × 10-17 cm3 s -1 for [I3-] ) 0.05Mat24 °C.},

abstract = {Abstract The physical origin of the open-circuit voltage in bulk heterojunction solar cells is still not well understood. While significant evidence exists to indicate that the open-circuit voltage is limited by the molecular orbital energies of the heterojunction components, it is clear that this picture is not sufficient to explain the significant variations which often occur between cells fabricated from the same heterojunction components. We present here an analysis of the variation in open-circuit voltage between 0.4–0.65 V observed for a range of P3HT/PCBM solar cells where device deposition conditions, electrode structure, active-layer thickness and device polarity are varied. The analysis quantifies non-geminate recombination losses of dissociated carriers in these cells, measured under device operating conditions. It is found that at open-circuit, losses due to non-geminate recombination are sufficiently large that other loss pathways may effectively be neglected. Variations in open-circuit voltage between different devices are shown to arise from differences in the rate coefficient for non-geminate recombination, and from differences in the charge densities in the photoactive layer of the device. The origin of these differences is discussed, particularly with regard to variations in film microstructure. By separately quantifying these differences in rate coefficient and charge density, and by application of a simple physical model based upon the assumption that open-circuit is reached when the flux of charge photogeneration is matched by the flux of non-geminate recombination, we are able to calculate correctly the open-circuit voltage for all the cells studied to within an accuracy of ±5 mV.},

The large absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility and good stability of organo-lead halide perovskites present good potential for their use as light harvesters in mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells. This work concentrated on a unique property of the lead halide perovskite, its function simultaneously as a light harvester and a hole conductor in the solar cell. A two-step deposition technique was used to optimize the perovskite deposition and to enhance the solar cell efficiency. It was revealed that the photovoltaic performance of the hole conductor free perovskite solar cell is strongly dependent on the depletion layer width which was created at the TiO2-CH3NH3PbI3 junction. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that there were no changes in the crystallographic structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite over time, which supports the high stability of these hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of the best cells reached 10.85{\%} with a fill factor of 68{\%}, a Voc of 0.84 V, and a Jsc of 19 mA cm(-2), the highest efficiency to date of a hole conductor free perovskite solar cell.},

In the absence of chloride, the film growth of CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) is directed by substrate interfacial energy. By employing the through-plane TEM analysis, we gain detailed insight into the unique crystallographic textures, grain structures, and elemental distributions across the breadth of films grown from precursor solutions with different chemistries. The lattice coherence seen in morphologies generated under the influence of chloride provides a physical rational for the enhancement in carrier diffusion length and lifetime.},

abstract = {The most accurate value of total solar irradiance during the 2008 solar minimum period is 1360.8 ± 0.5 W m−2 according to measurements from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and a series of new radiometric laboratory tests. This value is significantly lower than the canonical value of 1365.4 ± 1.3 W m−2 established in the 1990s, which energy balance calculations and climate models currently use. Scattered light is a primary cause of the higher irradiance values measured by the earlier generation of solar radiometers in which the precision aperture defining the measured solar beam is located behind a larger, view-limiting aperture. In the TIM, the opposite order of these apertures precludes this spurious signal by limiting the light entering the instrument. We assess the accuracy and stability of irradiance measurements made since 1978 and the implications of instrument uncertainties and instabilities for climate research in comparison with the new TIM data. TIM's lower solar irradiance value is not a change in the Sun's output, whose variations it detects with stability comparable or superior to prior measurements; instead, its significance is in advancing the capability of monitoring solar irradiance variations on climate-relevant time scales and in improving estimates of Earth energy balance, which the Sun initiates.},

abstract = {Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) cells of the design FTO/sTiO2/mpTiO2/MAPI/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide, sTiO2 indicates solid-TiO2, and mpTiO2 is mesoporous TiO2, are studied using transient photovoltage (TPV), differential capacitance, charge extn., current interrupt, and chronophotoamperometry. We show that in mpTiO2/MAPI cells there are two kinds of extractable charge stored under operation: a capacitive electronic charge (∼0.2 $\mu$C/cm2) and another, larger charge (40 $\mu$C/cm2), possibly related to mobile ions. Transient photovoltage decays are strongly double exponential with two time consts. that differ by a factor of ∼5, independent of bias light intensity. The fast decay (∼1 $\mu$s at 1 sun) is assigned to the predominant charge recombination pathway in the cell. We examine and reject the possibility that the fast decay is due to ferroelec. relaxation or to the bulk photovoltaic effect. Like many MAPI solar cells, the studied cells show significant J-V hysteresis. Capacitance vs open circuit voltage (Voc) data indicate that the hysteresis involves a change in internal potential gradients, likely a shift in band offset at the TiO2/MAPI interface. The TPV results show that the Voc hysteresis is not due to a change in recombination rate const. Calcn. of recombination flux at Voc suggests that the hysteresis is also not due to an increase in charge sepn. efficiency and that charge generation is not a function of applied bias. We also show that the J-V hysteresis is not a light driven effect but is caused by exposure to elec. bias, light or dark. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {How much energy could be generated if PV modules were installed on all of the suitable roof area in the nation? To answer this question, we first use GIS methods to process a lidar dataset and determine the amount of roof area that is suitable for PV deployment in 128 cities nationwide, containing 23{\%} of U.S. buildings, and provide PV-generation results for a subset of those cities. We then extend the insights from that analysis to the entire continental United States. We develop two statistical models--one for small buildings and one for medium and large buildings--and populate them with geographic variables that correlate with rooftop's suitability for PV. We simulate the productivity of PV installed on the suitable roof area, and present the technical potential of PV on both small buildings and medium/large buildings for every state in the continental US. Within the 128 cities covered by lidar data, 83{\%} of small buildings have a location suitable for a PV installation, but only 26{\%} of the total rooftop area of small buildings is suitable for development. The sheer number of buildings in this class, however, gives small buildings the greatest technical potential. Small building rooftops could accommodate 731 GW of PV capacity and generate 926 TWh/year of PV energy, approximately 65{\%} of rooftop PV's total technical potential. We conclude by summing the PV-generation results for all building sizes and therefore answering our original question, estimating that the total national technical potential of rooftop PV is 1,118 GW of installed capacity and 1,432 TWh of annual energy generation. This equates to 39{\%} of total national electric-sector sales.},
