characterization.tex:		In \cref{fig:iv_params}, the \gls{ff} can be graphically obtained from the ratio of the areas of the two rectangles.
characterization.tex:		Additionally, the fact that the illumination reaches the mask from a wide angle (the illumination passes through spread lenses, whose size is not small compared to the lamp-cell distance) allows the light to spread through the substrate glass (\SI{2.2}{\mm} for our \gls{fto} substrates) illuminating a large area on the active layer, as represented in \cref{fig:shadowing_mask}.
characterization.tex:	In literature one can easily find current\hyp{}voltage curves with discontinuities or "kinks" \cite{Li2016,Snaith2014,Zhang2015} like the one reported in \cref{fig:autoscale}, this is usually left unexplained.
characterization.tex:	The used sweep speed is \SI{500}{\mV\per\s}, which was arbitrarily chosen for avoiding bumps leading to currents higher than \gls{jsc}, like the one in \cref{fig:iv_ugly} (seldom reported in literature, like in figure~S3 of \cite{Du2018} or for different speeds in \cite{CorreaBaena2015,Tress2015,Unger2014} and simulated with drift-diffusion in \cite{Walter2018}).
characterization.tex:	The noise often observed in current-voltage sweeps at high scan speeds in this thesis is mainly caused by oscillations in the solar simulator illumination intensity, as an example see \cref{fig:iv_params}.
characterization.tex:		This is illustrated in \cref{fig:vapp_builtin} where a simulation of an homojunction device is reported.
characterization.tex:	Regarding the extracted charge, the ionic profile can influence the amount of accumulated charge, as shown for two extreme cases of presence/absence of ionic charges in \cref{fig:ce_full_dd}, so a reproducible procedure for device stabilization will also improve the reproducibility of the integrated current amount.
characterization.tex:	Most of the observed short\hyp{}time noise (\SI{< 5E-7}{\s}) observable in \cref{fig:ce_noise-normal} is related to the opening and closing of the transistor switches included in the home\hyp{}made circuit.
characterization.tex:	The noise can be ignored in some cases, but it is a problem if the charge \textsl{versus} light bias (\gls{voc} generated at a given illumination intensity) profile, reported on the right hand column of \cref{fig:ce_noise}, has to be studied in detail, as in \cref{ch:tae}.
characterization.tex:	As can be seen in \cref{fig:ce_noise-subtractDark}, this technique is working for most of the cases but it can fail if the noise profile changes in a more complex fashion.
characterization.tex:	A simulation with Driftfusion has been performed for an homojunction device, the evolution of the energy levels is shown in \cref{fig:ce_levels_corrected} and two well distinct processes are observed with the extraction of free charges over short times and the rearrangement of ionic defects over long times.
characterization.tex:	In \cref{fig:ce_single_dd-ions}, we can see the fast extraction of the free charges in the short time region.
characterization.tex:	Zooming in the long times region, shown in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd-ions_zoom}, we can see that a very weak but long lasting current appears and gives a relevant contribution to the integrated charge, this is caused by the slow ionic profile change (and the related displacement current).
characterization.tex:		We can see in \cref{fig:chargeExtraction_RCtime} a weak covariance (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.3) between the RC time obtained extrapolating the dark capacitance from \acr{dc} (which is the geometric capacitance) and the extraction time (as obtained by an exponential fitting to a single \acr{ce} current decay) at low light intensity (enough for having a signal but far from 1~sun light intensity).
characterization.tex:		So this part of the extracted charge, distinguishable as the linear part of the charge \textsl{versus} voltage plot, as represented on the right column of \cref{fig:ce_noise} should not be corrected.
characterization.tex:		Instead, regarding the charge accumulating in the perovskite layer, which we assume can be assigned to a chemical capacitance and can be recognized as the exponential part on the right column of \cref{fig:ce_noise}, it may be that a correction \cite{Shuttle2008a,Shuttle2008b} is needed, but this has not be attempted in this thesis.
characterization.tex:		Some covariance (Pearson correlation coefficient of~0.4) can be observed in \cref{fig:ce_1sun_time_vs_tpv_1sun_time} between the \acr{ce} and the \acr{tpv} time constants at 1 sun illumination.
characterization.tex:						The green solid line represent the situation as stabilized at open circuit conditions, before the \acr{ce} experiment. Corresponding energy levels for (\textbf{a}) in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_levels-1sun} and for (\textbf{b}) in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_levels-1000suns}.
characterization.tex:						The dotted violet line is the final electronic profile, at long times after the mobile ions migration, which is identical for (\textbf{a}) and (\textbf{b}) cases. Corresponding energy levels in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_levels-dark}.
characterization.tex:		This carriers accumulation in the contacts can be visualized with the simulation reported in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_charge-1sun}.
characterization.tex:		As we mentioned, the linear trend is related to the accumulation in the contacts depletion layers (or, generically, space charge layers), this can be seen from the decrease of the perovskite\hyp{}contacts conduction band offset between \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_levels-dark,,fig:ce_single_dd_levels-1sun}.
characterization.tex:		This means the depletion layers are close to saturation, like in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_levels-1000suns} where \SI{1000}{suns} illumination was simulated, and the charge accumulates in the perovskite layer, as shown in \cref{fig:ce_single_dd_charge-1000suns}, and the exponential trend gains importance.
characterization.tex:		This can be visualized with the simulation reported in \cref{fig:ce_full_dd} where the long timescale (where the current is monitored until complete stabilization) and the short timescale (few tens of microseconds) \acr{ce} experiment are compared.
characterization.tex:		For this case, the simulated extracted charge was identical to the reported short timescale extraction simulation in \cref{fig:ce_full_dd}.
characterization.tex:		As can be seen in \cref{fig:ce_full_dd}, the simulated geometric capacitance is similar to the one obtained from short time extraction with mobile ions but the exponential part is considerably different.
characterization.tex:	From this kinetic profile, a charge lifetime can be obtained and plotted against the light bias due to the constant background illumination, as in the example of \cref{fig:tpv-monoexp}.
characterization.tex:	An example can be seen in \cref{fig:tpv_robust}.
characterization.tex:	For example, comparing the excess charge in a \gls{fto}\-/\ch{d-TiO2}\-/\acr{csfamapbibr}\-/\gls{spiro}\-/\ch{Au} solar cell at \gls{voc} and at \gls{voc}~+~\SI{10}{\mV} which can be obtained from the data in \cref{fig:ce_noise-integrateExp} fitted with \cref{eq:ce_full} we can obtain respectively a value of \SI{8.2E-8}{} and \SI{8.9E-8}{\coulomb\per\square\cm}.
characterization.tex:		For some devices, rather than an exponential decay, a bi\hyp{}exponential voltage decay is observed, like the one reported in \cref{fig:tpv-biexp_single}.
characterization.tex:		While bi\hyp{}exponential decays at high background illumination are often not observed, these are quite always present at lower background illumination, as in for the example reported in \cref{fig:tpv-biexp_full}.
characterization.tex:		In \cref{fig:tpv_ionic-reference} the steady state energy levels and ionic accumulation at the perovskite/contact interfaces is represented.
characterization.tex:		In \cref{fig:tpv_ionic-cb} the variations of the conduction band profile are plotted.
characterization.tex:		At the same times, we can see in \cref{fig:tpv_ionic-dynamics} the increase in the total amount of electrons in the device due to the laser photo-generation which is reflected also by the open circuit voltage increase, as expected for a \acr{tpv} experiment.
characterization.tex:		In \cref{fig:tpv_ionic-cb} this is visible as a flattening of the conduction band in the perovskite, this simple displacement of ions decreases the electrostatic potential at the \gls{etm}.
characterization.tex:		In the same time span, in \cref{fig:tpv_ionic-dynamics} we can see how the ionic concentration at an interface changes and how this gets reflected on the open circuit voltage, without any change in the total charge concentration.
characterization.tex:		This affirmation is corroborated by the correlation observable in \cref{fig:tpv_RCtime}.
characterization.tex:		As shown, the lifetime typically decreases exponentially with the light bias, as experimentally observed in the example of \cref{fig:tpv-monoexp}, with an ideality modifier of $v = m/(\Phi-1)$.
characterization.tex:		As a reference, the \cref{fig:tpvce-full,,fig:tpvce-nogeom} can be compared where the full charge from \acr{ce} is employed in the former while just the charge from chemical capacitance was used for the latter.
characterization.tex:		Using \cref{eq:tpv_tau_order} for fitting the data, we can obtain physically unreasonable recombination orders when considering the full charge from \acr{ce} (reported in \cref{fig:tpvce-full}).
characterization.tex:		Instead, fitting data with the exponential component of \acr{ce} only, the recombination orders obtained are between 1 and 2, which are the expected values (reported in \cref{fig:tpvce-nogeom,,fig:tpvce-nogeom_total}).
characterization.tex:		This simple correction allows us to make a meaningful comparison between recombination rates at a given charge density, as represented in \cref{fig:tpvce-nogeom_total}.
characterization.tex:	The electrical capacitance of most of the commercial capacitors is independent on the applied voltage, as represented in \cref{fig:cap_voltage_dependence_commercial} where the capacitance was measured with a modified \acr{ce} experiment where the pre\hyp{}conditioning was done directly applying a voltage instead of applying a light bias.
characterization.tex:	On the contrary, the electrical capacitance of a solar cell does depend on the applied voltage or light bias, as shown in \cref{fig:cap_voltage_dependence_tae1}.
characterization.tex:	As an example, we can compare the $\Delta V$ obtained with the aforementioned criteria applied on the \acr{tpv} decay in \cref{fig:tpv_robust}: \SI{16.5}{\mV} from the maximum point; \SI{4.2}{\mV} from the simple mono\hyp{}exponential fit; \SI{3.3}{\mV} from the robust mono\hyp{}exponential fit ; \SI{5.9}{\mV} from the simple bi\hyp{}exponential fit; \SI{6.1}{\mV} from the robust bi\hyp{}exponential fit (see \cpageref{tpv_robust} for discussion on robust fitting); \SI{4.2}{\mV} from the maximum of the \gls{loess}; \SI{4.6}{\mV} using the average of the first points after the peak.
characterization.tex:	To further illustrate the sensibility of \acr{dc} from the $\Delta V$ estimation, the capacitance of four devices from \cite{Gelmetti2019} has been reported in \cref{fig:dc_deltaV}.
impedance.tex:	We proposed that both of the effects (apparent capacitance and inductance) can be described by transistors element in the circuit, as represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-transistor}.
impedance.tex:	As represented in \cref{fig:impedance_flowchart}, before analysing the oscillating solutions, the stabilization is verified comparing the last time point profiles with the profiles at the half of the current simulation (so at the \nth{10} period).
impedance.tex:	As can be seen in \cref{fig:demodulation}, this method works both with sinusoidal profiles obtained from small perturbation simulations and also for large perturbation signals including distortion by higher harmonics.
impedance.tex:As we can see comparing \cref{fig:impedance-capacitance-oc,fig:impedance-capacitance-vapp}, when oscillating the voltage around \gls{voc} on an illuminated solution or around the same values for a dark solution, the result is very similar.
impedance.tex:This behaviour is also observed experimentally, as reported in \cref{fig:experimental-vapp}.
impedance.tex:This can be seen in \cref{fig:impedance-delta_charge-highFreq} from the presence of net charge out of the depletion layers, at the electrodes\-/contacts interface (left and right simulation boundaries).
impedance.tex:We can see this as a non~\SI{90}{\degree} phase in the extremely high frequency region of \cref{fig:impedance-ionic-phase} and as a decrease of the apparent capacitance in \cref{fig:impedance-capacitance-oc}.
impedance.tex:	Looking at the phase in the high frequency region for \SI{1}{sun} illuminated case in \cref{fig:impedance-ionic-phase}, we can see a trend similar to the one observed for the dark case.
impedance.tex:	In this region, the frequency is slow enough for the contacts' depletion layers population/depopulation and for the migration of the free carriers in the perovskite layer, as represented in \cref{fig:impedance-delta_charge-midFreq_dark}.
impedance.tex:	This distance can be estimated from the distance of the peaks in \cref{fig:impedance-delta_charge-midFreq_dark} as \SI{625}{\nm}.
impedance.tex:		As can be seen in \cref{fig:impedance-accumulation}, with the illumination, the apparent capacitance of the mid frequency plateau increases up to \SI{7.60e-8}{\farad\per\square\cm} at \SI{1}{sun}.
impedance.tex:		This is caused by the large amount of free carriers in the perovskite due to the illumination (or due to the voltage bias for the dark case reported in \cref{fig:impedance-capacitance-vapp}).
impedance.tex:		As shown in \cref{fig:impedance-delta_charge-midFreq_1sun}, the free carriers drift inside of the perovskite layer causing a dipole.
impedance.tex:	This is represented by the capacitor in \cref{fig:cap_scheme_hi_freq}.
impedance.tex:	The activation of the ionic movement can be seen in the phase of ionic displacement current represented in \cref{fig:impedance-ionic-phase}.
impedance.tex:	This is expected as the ionic species can just accumulate or deplete at the interfaces of the perovskite layer with the contacts (simulations where ions could penetrate in the contacts have been performed but will not be reported in this thesis) screening the electric field, like in the capacitor represented in \cref{fig:cap_scheme_low_freq}.
impedance.tex:	Indeed, calculating an apparent capacitance value from the ionic displacement current (see \cpageref{displacement_current_ionic,intro_displacement_current}) we can see that it matches the apparent capacitance value in dark, reported in \cref{fig:impedance-ionic-capacitance}.
impedance.tex:	As can be seen in the low frequency region of \cref{fig:impedance-accumulation}, just the dark case can be explained by the accumulation capacitance resulting from the charges actually being stored in the device.
impedance.tex:	Comparing \cref{fig:impedance-delta_charge-midFreq_dark} with \cref{fig:impedance-delta_charge-midFreq_1sun} we can see how the different thickness of the space charge layers with different bias voltages (or dark \textsl{versus} \SI{1}{sun}) implies that the charge variation happens at different distances from the materials' interface.
impedance.tex:	Looking at the low frequency region of \cref{fig:impedance-ionic-capacitance}, we can see how the ionic capacitance (so the amount of displaced ions) increases with the illumination or applied voltage.
impedance.tex:In these cases, the device interfaces are usually considered like a $p$-$n$ junction diode, where the energy barrier just depends on the voltage across it as represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-diode_scheme}.
impedance.tex:the applied voltage is experienced as an electric field in the intrinsic layer and the recombination barrier represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-band_diagram_hifreq} vary by the same amount and in the same moment as the applied voltage.
impedance.tex:The equivalent electrical circuit for this regime is represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-diode}.
impedance.tex:In the low frequency, the ions have time for continuously screening the field induced by the varying voltage, as represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-band_diagram_lowfreq}.
impedance.tex:Contrariwise to what happened at mid and high frequencies in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-band_diagram_hifreq}, we can see how at low frequency the variation of the recombination energy barrier is not just the applied voltage.
impedance.tex:Checking the energy barrier in a transistor, as represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-transistor_scheme}, we can see how this circuit element can include the contribution of two different potentials: the applied voltage $V$ and the ionic electrostatic potential $V_1$.
impedance.tex:In the equivalent electrical circuit, we can include the ionic capacitance as in \cref{fig:cap_scheme_low_freq} and replace the interfacial diode with a transistor having the ionic potential as the gating potential, as represented in \cref{fig:diode_transistor-transistor}.
impedance.tex:Indeed, if we use the recombination current, calculated as described in \cpageref{impedance_recombination}, for calculating an impedance and the relative apparent capacitance, we can see that this matches perfectly the simulated apparent capacitance, as reported in \cref{fig:impedance-recombination}.
impedance.tex:This low frequency feature accounts for the arch on the right of the Nyquist plot represented in \cref{fig:impedance-nyquist}.
impedance.tex:As represented in \cref{fig:holes_concentration}, the distance of the quasi\hyp{}Fermi level from the corresponding band level indicates the density of the corresponding carrier.
impedance.tex:In \cref{fig:diode_transistor-band_diagram_hifreq,fig:diode_transistor-band_diagram_lowfreq} the vertical arrows indicate the distance of conduction band quasi\hyp{}Fermi level from conduction band, the closer the higher the electrons concentration.
impedance.tex:		Additionally, a large perturbation measurement, which is a wide sinusoidal voltage oscillation amplitude in impedance measurements, has been simulated to also cause loops in the Nyquist plot positive semi\hyp{}plane, as represented in \cref{fig:impedance-200mV}.
impedance.tex:The fact that a large voltage perturbation causes a non\hyp{}sinusoidal current output is not a problem for the measurement itself, as the lock-in amplifiers are perfectly able to extract amplitude and phase of the signal's first harmonic (as shown in \cref{fig:demodulation}), ignoring the higher harmonics.
impedance.tex:						In (\textbf{b}), for the same conditions, the phase of the experimental impedance is reported, it can be compared with simulated data in \cref{fig:impedance-ionic-phase}.
impedance.tex:						In (\textbf{c}), for the same conditions, the experimental apparent capacitance is reported, it can be compared with simulated data in \cref{fig:impedance-capacitance}.
impedance.tex:An attempt of adapting the impedance scripts to the most recent heterojunction version of Driftfusion confirmed the presence of negative capacitance due to injection barrier modulation by ionic charge, as shown in \cref{fig:impedance_heterojunction}.
impedance.tex:For example, converting a bi\hyp{}exponential decay in \gls{tpv} to frequency domain through Fourier transform, we can obtain two arches in the IMVS Nyquist plot or from a bi\hyp{}exponential current evolution after a voltage step we can obtain the impedance spectroscopy features (preliminary simulation performed by Dr.\ Piers Barnes) as shown in \cref{fig:impedance_fourier}.
impedance.tex:	The logical flowchart of a complete impedance spectra simulation has been represented in \cref{fig:impedance_flowchart}.
intro.tex:	Indeed, the abundance of solar irradiation (represented in \cref{fig:world_map-PVOUT}) is quite high in most of the regions where life quality is seriously affected by economical situation (represented in \cref{fig:world_map-HDI} by the Human Development Index).
intro.tex:	In \cref{fig:world_map-electrical_vs_land} we can see how electricity consumption density is greatly inhomogeneous and comparing with the photovoltaic potential map in \cref{fig:world_map-PVOUT}, it is evident that such a problem is shared with many other poorly insulated but energy eager regions.
intro.tex:		The energy that an electron can have when it is bound in a nanometric volume (like a molecular bond) is quantized, the possible energies are represented in \cref{fig:homo_lumo}.
intro.tex:		For a 3D crystal, the density of states can be approximated to be the \gls{dos} of a free electrons gas where it grows with the square root of the energy, as represented in \cref{fig:DOS} \cite[140]{Kittel2004}.
intro.tex:		For example, considering the 3D crystalline system represented in \cref{fig:DOS} if the Fermi level approaches the conduction band edge, the population at that edge state can be estimated using \cref{eq:fermidirac}: $\frac{n_|eDOS|}{\exp[(E_|CB|-E_|CB|)/(k_|B|T)]+1} = n_|eDOS|/2$ so half full, while the valence band will be close to completely full (many electrons, very few holes).
intro.tex:		This situation can happen in "extrinsic" or "doped" semiconductors, where the presence of, for example, positive ionic Schottky defects or oxidised species can compensate the charge of the high electrons concentration and result in a charge neutral material, as represented in \cref{fig:homojunction-doping}.
intro.tex:		When observing a band diagram, like the one reported in \cref{fig:holes_concentration}, it is very easy to have an idea of the carriers concentrations observing the distance between the quasi\hyp{}Fermi levels and the band edges.
intro.tex:		For example, in \cref{fig:holes_concentration} we can see that the closer the $E_|fp|$ (quasi\hyp{}Fermi level relative to the valence band) gets to the valence band, the higher the holes concentration in it.
intro.tex:		As represented in \cref{fig:drift_diffusion-drift}, in a typical energy diagram electrons drift downhill and holes drift uphill.
intro.tex:As represented in \cref{fig:drift_diffusion-diffusion}, particles in highly concentrated zones tend to move towards less densely occupied ones.
intro.tex:		For easing the understanding of the band diagram, the scheme in \cref{fig:homojunction-poisson_and_depletion} can be handful.
intro.tex:		As represented in \cref{fig:homojunction-poisson_and_depletion}, when two materials with different Fermi levels are brought into contact their free charges migrate until when the Fermi level is flattened.
intro.tex:		When this involves the majority carriers (holes for a p-type material) exiting a material and leaving behind the charge from the doping species, this is named a depletion layer and is the case represented in \cref{fig:homojunction-poisson_and_depletion}.
intro.tex:		Extending this concept to the aforementioned example of semiconductors in contact, it is easy to see that far from the interfaces the electric field is zero, or "screened" by the charged layers, as represented in \cref{fig:homojunction-poisson_and_depletion}.
intro.tex:Taking as a reference the charges shown in \cref{fig:homojunction-poisson_and_depletion}, the holes in the bulk of the p-type material (leftmost and rightmost) will diffuse towards the interface, just because of the concentration gradient (close to the interface the material is depleted of holes).
intro.tex:		Another example, in an intrinsic material there are few free charges and the space charge layer will be much thicker, as in \cref{fig:homojunction-poisson_and_depletion}.
intro.tex:		An example is represented in \cref{fig:displacement_current-ionic}: the amperometer can measure a current even if no charge crossed the perovskite/electrode interface, this is a displacement current caused by the creation of a dipole due to the ionic accumulation at the interfaces.
intro.tex:		The concept is represented in \cref{fig:dipole_plane}.
intro.tex:		This is represented in \cref{fig:generation-excited_hot} for a high energy photon generating a hot excitation \ch{M^{*h}} (which later can result in a hot exciton and a hot carrier, not treated in this thesis) or in \cref{fig:generation-excited} for a photon with just enough energy to generate an excitation \ch{M^{*}}.
intro.tex:						In (\textbf{a}) the fundamental molecular electronic configuration is represented, for the meaning of the levels refer to \cref{fig:homo_lumo}.
intro.tex:		The starting state of the electron involved in the radiative excitation is the \gls{homo} of the molecule \ch{M}, marked in \cref{fig:generation-initial} with $\alpha$.
intro.tex:		So the arrival state of the excited electron, marked with $\gamma$ in \cref{fig:generation-excited}, is at a lower energy than the initial state \gls{lumo} ($\beta$) and the optical band gap (which can be measured from absorbance spectrum \textsl{via} a Tauc plot) is smaller than the band gap (difference between the electron affinity and the ionization potential represented in \cref{fig:homo_lumo}).
intro.tex:		Next to the excitation, an electron can either go back (recombine) or start getting apart from the original location, as represented in \cref{fig:generation-exciton} where it has been transferred to an adjacent molecule.
intro.tex:		In the exampled reported in \cref{fig:collection}, the gradients in the charges' concentrations cause diffusion currents.
intro.tex:		In the exampled reported in \cref{fig:collection}, the curvature of the bands indicates the presence of electric field driving the charges' drift.
intro.tex:		So the difference between the $E_|fp|$ at the \gls{htm}/electrode interface ($\alpha$ in \cref{fig:collection}) and the $E_|fn|$ at the \gls{etm}/electrode interface ($\beta$ in \cref{fig:collection}) gets reflected into the electrodes Fermi level, which ultimately can be measured as a voltage.
methods.tex:	The "top" or "bottom" naming refers to the cell orientation during fabrication, so the "bottom" layer is the one closer to the glass substrate, as shown in \cref{fig:device_naming}.
methods.tex:	Both the top and the bottom cathode solar cells were fabricated following the scheme reported in \cref{fig:device_layout}.
methods.tex:		In \cref{fig:microscope_degradation} the degradation of a complete device exposed to continuous illumination for \SI{10}{\minute} and ambient air conditions is shown.
software.tex:		I went on adding functions and expanding the \gls{gui} until obtaining a fully functional alternative to the legacy LabView software shown in \cref{fig:old_iv_software}.
software.tex:Here the user can find the parameters which most likely will vary within an experiment: the illumination intensity, the device identification string (substrate codename), the identification number of the diode in the substrate (with a numeric up-down, in case there are more than one, see \cref{fig:device}), and the sweep scan direction (with a check box, see \cpageref{characterization_fwdrev}).
software.tex:After closing and opening the illumination shutter, it starts a single current\hyp{}voltage scan, then updates the parameters shown in the large boxes and spawns a plot window like the one in \cref{fig:pypv-plot}.
software.tex:In this table on the right side of the software (see \cref{fig:pypv-gui}), the saved measurement identification and parameters are displayed.
software.tex:Python console in \cref{fig:pypv-console} is used mainly for reporting additional data \textsl{e.g.} where the files got saved or each of the measured steady state \gls{voc} points.
software.tex:Keithley's display in \cref{fig:pypv-keithley} is used for communicating to the user which diode has to be measured during the "AutoMeasure".
software.tex:When using the "AutoSave" of the "AutoMeasure" functions, inside the aforementioned directory the measurements are named with the following schema: \texttt{experiment name-device name-\textit{<diode>}-\textit{<direction>}.txt} where \textit{\texttt{<diode>}} is the identification number of the specific diode under measurement, in case there is more than one per substrate (\textsl{e.g.} in our case, each device has four independent diodes, as can be seen in \cref{fig:device}) and \texttt{\textit{<direction>}} can be either \texttt{forward} or \texttt{reverse}, as explained in \cpageref{characterization_fwdrev} for the sweep scan direction.
software.tex:		Then it integrates the current profile over time starting from time zero, which is the moment when circuit gets closed but due to some delay induced by the transistors the current flows just a few tenths of microsecond after, as shown in \cref{fig:ce_noise-normal}.
software.tex:		See \cpageref{characterization_subtractDark} and \cref{fig:ce_noise-subtractDark} for a more complete description.
software.tex:				See \cpageref{characterization_integrateExp} and \cref{fig:ce_noise-integrateExp} for a more complete description.
software.tex:		This is used for comparisons like the one in the right column of \cref{fig:ce_noise}.
software.tex:		bi-exponential fitting, robust fitting \cite{Maechler2018}, save the plots to PNG or PDF files, plot all the data points or use a 2D histogram for reducing the overplotting problem (see \cref{fig:tpv_robust}), additionally plot with abscissa and/or ordinate axis in logarithmic scale, plot residuals, allow the fitting to match negative peaks.
software.tex:An example of all the mentioned plots can be observed in \cref{fig:tpvce,fig:tae_photophysics_tpvcedc}.
software.tex:	As the effort in this project were very limited on my side, I will not further describe that but an example of the output is reported in \cref{fig:mppt}.
tae.tex:	As can be seen in \cref{fig:tae-afm}, all the layers have irregularities but seems that the coverage is complete.
tae.tex:	The elemental analysis of the small features observed in \gls{spiro} in \cref{fig:tae-afm-spiro} were further studied with ESEM-EDX, resulting in a composition no significantly different from the rest of the surface.
tae.tex:The diffraction patterns are shown in \cref{fig:tae_xrd} and no difference can be observed between the pristine and the covered perovskite layers structure.
tae.tex:				J-V curve for record devices are reported in \cref{fig:tae-jv_champions}.
tae.tex:	As can be seen in \cref{fig:tae_photophysics_tpv}, the small perturbation lifetimes at \SI{1}{sun} illumination (for each device, the point at bottom right in the series) does not differ by much: from \SI{0.3}{\us} for \gls{spiro} to \SI{1.1}{\us} for \gls{tae4}.
tae.tex:	A much more meaningful result can be obtained referencing the small perturbation lifetimes obtained from \gls{tpv} to the chemical charge concentration (the charge stored in the perovskite layer, estimated from the exponential parts of \cref{fig:tae_photophysics_cedc}), and correcting the resulting data with the recombination order, as explained in \cpageref{characterization_tpvce}.
tae.tex:	The difference in lifetimes in \gls{tae4} devices when referencing to \gls{ce} or \gls{dc} is due to the large incoherence of \gls{ce} or \gls{dc} for this device, as shown in \cref{fig:tae_photophysics_cedc}.
tae.tex:			The experimental data reported in \cref{fig:tae_photophysics_tpvcedc} has been fitted using \cref{eq:tpv_tau_vs_intensity} for \gls{tpv} data (using a $T$ of \SI{300}{\celsius}) and \cref{eq:tau_pfo} for \gls{tpvce} and \gls{tpvdc} data.
tae.tex:					In (\textbf{b}) the lifetime is plotted versus the exponential part of the charge from \gls{ce} reported in \cref{fig:tae_photophysics-ce} and corrected using \cref{eq:tau_pfo} with the recombination order obtained from the power\hyp{}law fit of the same graph.
tae.tex:					In (\textbf{c}) the lifetime is plotted versus the chemical charge from \gls{dc} obtained subtracting the constant geometric capacitance from the data reported in \cref{fig:tae_photophysics-dc} and integrating it.
thicknesses.tex:			J-V curve for record devices are reported in \cref{fig:thicknesses-jv_champions-mapi,fig:thicknesses-jv_champions-pcbm,fig:thicknesses-jv_champions-pedotpss}.
thicknesses.tex:	As a consequence to the different deposition conditions, the \gls{mapi} surface is more rough for the thick device than for the thin one, as can be intuited looking at \gls{esem} image in \cref{fig:thicknesses-esem-topview}.
thicknesses.tex:	From the same \gls{esem} image, we can measure the grain lateral size, which is not significantly different for the six observed samples (two per each \gls{mapi} thickness, data detailed in \cref{fig:thicknesses-esem-topview} caption).
thicknesses.tex:	In \cref{fig:thicknesses-jv_champions-mapi} we can observe the current-voltage sweeps of the champion devices while in \cref{table:thicknesses_jv} the averages and standard deviations are reported.
thicknesses.tex:				The experimental data reported in \cref{fig:thicknesses-mapi-geometric,fig:thicknesses-pcbm-geometric,fig:thicknesses-pedotpss-geometric} has been fitted using \cref{eq:ce_full} for \gls{ce} data and \cref{eq:dc_full} for \gls{dc} data.
thicknesses.tex:	From the low and mid background light capacitance obtained from \gls{dc} in \cref{fig:thicknesses-mapi-geometric-dc} and from the linear part of \gls{ce} in \cref{fig:thicknesses-mapi-geometric-ce} we can obtain a geometric capacitance $C_|g|$, as explained in \cref{ch:characterization}.
thicknesses.tex:	In \cref{fig:thicknesses-jv_champions-pcbm} we can observe the current-voltage sweeps of the champion devices while in \cref{table:thicknesses_jv} the averages and standard deviations are reported.
thicknesses.tex:	In \cref{fig:thicknesses-jv_champions-pedotpss} we can observe the current-voltage sweeps of the champion devices while in \cref{table:thicknesses_jv} the averages and standard deviations are reported.
thicknesses.tex:	Changing the \gls{pedotpss} \gls{htm} layer thickness did not affect the measured geometric capacitance values reported in \cref{table:thicknesses_photophysics} and observable in \cref{fig:thicknesses-pedotpss-geometric}.
