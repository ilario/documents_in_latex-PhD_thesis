\paragraph{Abstract} During my 3-month stay in Dr. Piers R. F. Barnes and Prof. Jenny Nelson groups I utilized and expanded a modelling software developed by Dr. Phil Calado, Dr. Mohammed Azzouzi, Benjamin Hilton, and Piers R. F. Barnes written in Matlab. As the modelling software had already demonstrated a great descriptive power\cite{Belisle2017, Calado2016}, I implemented a few more characterization techniques with the objective of reproducing and understanding real-world data.
