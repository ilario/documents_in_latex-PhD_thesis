\section{Why Photovoltaic}

	\paragraph{Abundance} The total solar irradiance hitting the outer Earth atmosphere is around \SI{1361}{\watt\per\square\metre},\cite{Kopp2011} which, considering our planet cross section area, makes \SI{1.6e17}{\watt}.
	Nature conveys this energy in plenty of ways, including the generation of every renewable and most of non-renewable energy sources.
	Solar energy is effectively the primary energy source for our planet's ecosystem, so it's the most interesting source of energy for human usage.

	\paragraph{Availability} Its ubiquitous availability can be the leverage for some degree of economical power levelling across different regions of the planet.
	This is even more interesting when considering that most of the regions where life quality is seriously affected by economy (represented in \cref{fig:world_map-HDI} by the Human Development Index) have abundance of solar irradiation (represented in \cref{fig:world_map-PVOUT} by the ratio between the photovoltaic electric energy that can be obtained over the nominal power of an installed solar panel).

	\end{figure}

	\paragraph{Resilience} Photovoltaic is the electric energy production method that best matches a distributed and decentralized network model, with the only single-point-of-failure being the climate variability.
	Combined with accumulation (needed for night time usage) and with other energy sources, it can be the pivot of a completely resilient electric energy provisioning system.

	\paragraph{More energy is not enough} It is intuitive that increasing the energy production is a high-price solution to the growing energetic demand.
	Indeed, in some regions a decrease in the electricity consumption has to be included for a long-term solution.
	For example, a study\cite{Margolis2016} reports that if every rooftop (not considering utility-scale solar facilities) in United States of America was covered with solar panel, just the 39~\% of its nowadays national consumption would be covered.
	In \cref{fig:world_map-electrical_vs_land} we can see how electricity consumption density is greatly inhomogeneous and comparing with the photovoltaic potential map in \cref{fig:world_map-PVOUT}, it is evident that such a problem is shared with many other poorly insulated but energy eager regions.
	Both an increase in machinery's efficiency and a change in life-style can be part of the solution, following the example and thinking at life-style, in USA the per capita energy usage is more than twice the European average, and five times the Latin America average.\cite{IEA}

	\paragraph{And more research is needed} Every source of electrical energy we can think of works via the conversion of motive power (a flow of steam, wind, or water, waves, tides...) to electricity, which relays on the well established electric generator. Except photovoltaic energy. This very simple difference already hints for the huge conceptual and technological step required by photovoltaics as compared to other electrical energy sources.

\subsection{Charge Recombination}

\paragraph{Primary geminate recombination} \label{intro_geminate} This kind of recombination happens with the annihilation of a photo-generated exciton prior to the free charges separation. This is independent from the illumination intensity, so it can be considered as having a reaction order of zero. Lead halide perovskite have quite a high static permittivity CITE IMPEDANCE and a small electron effective mass (high free carriers mobility) \cite{Herz2017}, this means that, at room temperature, the exciton binding energy is even smaller than $k_BT$ \cite{Miyata2015,Galkowski2016} and the direct generation of free charges occurs. So this kind of recombination is negligible in perovskite solar cells. %Non-geminate recombination refers to the annihilation of an electron and an hole happening after their complete separation, as opposed to geminate recombination where the recombination happens just after the charges separation but before their distancing.

\paragraph{Radiative recombination} This is an unavoidable form of recombination, which finds its origin in the detailed balance principle describing that all the absorbed thermal photons have to be re-emitted as black body radiation. From this parallelism it can be understood that it is larger for materials with greater absorptivity \cite{Nelson2003}. An indirect bandgap disfavours the radiative recombination: in these materials the recombination involves a large momentum variation, while the photon emitted due to the recombination can take just a small momentum and the rest of it should be released as an additional phonon (lattice vibrations). Radiative recombination involves the clash of two opposite free charges, so it can be considered as having a reaction order of 2 when electrons and holes concentrations are similar, $n \approx p$ (in intrinsic semiconductors out of the depletion layer or, in intrinsic perovskites, once ionic profile stabilized cancelling the electric field), while in case of uneven concentrations (in doped semiconductors or inside depletion layers) the limiting reagent is the minority carrier (electrons in p-type and holes in n-type materials) and the reaction order is 1. The expression used for modelling is: $U_{rad} = k_{rad} (np-n_i^2)$, where $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier density as obtained from Boltzmann distribution for an intrinsic semiconductor, it is just introduced in the equation in order to account for the thermal generation.

\paragraph{SRH trap mediated recombination} Also known as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination \cite{Shockley1952}, this recombination happens in two steps: a free charge from the respective band decays into an empty localized state with energy in between the valence and the conduction bands, a trap, after this event, a free charge of the opposite sign reaches the trapped charge location and recombine with it. Usually both the momentum difference and the chemical energy get released via phonons, so no radiative emission is involved. This recombination type can have reaction order of 1 or of 2 depending on how many of these steps constitutes a bottleneck \cite{Calado2018b}. In case of mid-gap traps (with energy in the middle of the bandgap), these states will be rather saturated and the process of trapping a free charge will be slow as an empty trap has to be hit, then the actual recombination is fast, so the reaction order is 1. In case of shallow traps, the first step could or could not be a bottleneck, this time depending on the availability of free charges to trap: in doped semiconductors this could be a limiting factor, and the reaction order would be again 1; in intrinsic semiconductors there will be plenty of free charges of both types, and the reaction order can get close to 2. The expression used for modelling is \cite{Shockley1952}:
$$U_{SRH} = k_{SRH} \frac{np-n_i^2}{\tau_n(p+p_t)+ \tau_p(n+n_t)}$$
where $n_t$ and $p_t$ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

\paragraph{Surface recombination} Also known as interfacial recombination, refers to the annihilation of one kind of free charge on a material with a charge of the opposite sign located on another material, happening at the materials' interface. At the interface between a, let's say, p-doped and a close-to-intrinsic material as we consider the perovskite, the surface recombination will involve the majority carrier, holes, in the doped material and the opposite charge in the intrinsic semiconductor. As the doped semiconductor has abundance of majority carriers, the limiting factor will be the concentration of "minority" carriers on the other side of the interface, which will depend on its mobility and on the electric field in the intrinsic. So the reaction order should be 1 for this case. As we will see below, this is the most important recombination pathway for perovskite solar cells.

\paragraph{Auger recombination} When a free charge gets in contact with another of the same kind, it is possible that one of these decays and the other absorbs the just released energy as kinetic energy. This recombination is important in materials with high free carriers densities or at high photo-generation conditions. Additionally to the two free charges of the same kind, it also requires a free charge of the opposite kind for the decay to be possible, so it can be considered as having a reaction order of three.

\subsection{Just the Needed Electrodynamics}
	
	\paragraph{Displacement current -- definition}\label{intro_displacement_current} The displacement current $J_D$ appears in the fourth macroscopic Maxwell's equation as $\partial D / \partial t$ for describing the contributions to magnetizing field not originated by a current of free charges $J_f$: $\nabla \times H = J_f + \frac{\partial D}{\partial t}$. The displacement electric field $D$ includes contributions from the electric field intensity $E$ and the polarization $P$: $D=\epsilon_0 E + P$ which can also be written in terms of relative permittivity $\epsilon_r$ as: $D= \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r E$. So its time derivative defining the displacement current is: $\frac{\partial D}{\partial t} = \epsilon_0 (\epsilon_r\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + E\frac{\partial \epsilon_r}{\partial t})$. For the scope of this thesis we're interested in the first term and we're going to ignore the second one considering the relative permittivity as a material dependent constant.

	\end{figure}
	
	
	\paragraph{Displacement current -- interpretation} So the displacement current accounts for the charge movements not identifiable as current and for their effect on the surrounding circuitry. An example is represented in \cref{fig:displacement_current-ionic}: the amperometer can measure a current even if no charge crossed the perovskite/electrode interface, this is a displacement current caused by the creation of a dipole due to the ionic accumulation at the interfaces. One can imagine the resulting current as needed for maintaining the zero potential difference between the two contacts. It is not, as one could erroneously and instinctively think, the effect of an electric field generated in the contacts by the moving charge in the perovskite layer (with related Coulomb force and image charges) as out of the two two-dimensional planes of opposed charges no electric field is present. This can be understood thinking that the electric field intensity generated by an large plate of charges has a constant magnitude at distances much smaller than the plate dimensions (which is always true in our solar cells considering the thickness \SI{\approx 1}{\um} to area \SI{3x3}{\square\mm} ratio, except at electrode edges). The concept is represented in \cref{fig:dipole_plane}. In \cpageref{displacement_current_ionic} we'll use the displacement current concept for simulating the current caused in the electrodes not by a net flux of charges through a device section but by the rearrangement of charges which not necessarily leave the device, like the ionic migration in perovskite material.

What is present outside of the sandwich is just an electrostatic potential difference.}\label{fig:dipole_plane}
	\end{figure}

	\paragraph{Continuity equations} The continuity equations have a very intuitive meaning: the concentration of a specie in a specific volume can increase due to generation $G$, can decrease due to recombination $U$ or can change due to a speed change of a charge flow passing by. This last contribution can be understood with the following example: a traffic light stops the cars flow and causes the increase of their concentration. For electron concentration $n$:	
$$\frac{\partial n_x}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{q}\nabla_x \cdot J_n + G_{n,x} - U_{n,x}$$

\section{Perovskite Solar Cells}

	Perovskite solar cells is a relatively new player in the photovoltaics world, existing just since 2009 (started by the research groups Miyasaka\cite{Kojima2009}, Park \cite{Im2011a,Kim2012b}, and Snaith \cite{Lee2012}). In relatively short time, see \cref{fig:nrel_chart}, these kind of devices reached a record efficiency of 20.9~\% \cite{Green2019} with reports of even higher efficiencies (23.7~\% \cite{Green2019,Jiang2017}).

	\end{SCfigure}


	\paragraph{Perovskite Absorber Synthesis}

	The preparation of this hybrid semiconductor via spin coating and annealing at low temperature is extremely easy and convenient for small-scale research purposes. From my point of view, what most affects the perovskite research is the lack of reproducibility, likely caused by the extremely sensible crystallization during the annealing phase. In literature various reports of completely different results obtained from perfectly identical synthesis can be found\cite{Pockett2015,Gottesman2014}. This issue is being addressed recently with the publication of more reliable and complete fabrication procedures \cite{Saliba2018}.

	\paragraph{Ionic migration}
	The presence of charged and mobile ionic species have been demonstrated in various kind of hybrid lead halide perovskite materials, via \gls{kpfm} \cite{Birkhold2018} XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The presence of mobile ions has been demonstrated also in absence of current-voltage hysteretic behaviour\cite{Calado2016,Jacobs2018}. It has also been demonstrated that for \gls{mapi} the majoritarian mobile species is the iodine vacancy XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \cite{Senocrate2017} and has been excluded a significant contribution from methylammonium ions \cite{Senocrate2018,Senocrate2017}.

	\paragraph{Intrinsic or doped semiconductor}

	\paragraph{Stability}
	The stability of the perovskite solar cells is the number one blocker to commercialization. Its keystone has still to be identified. An interesting investigation is being carried on by D. R. Ceratti and D. Cahen (unpublished) regarding the release of a proton by methylammonium cation when in contact with non-acidic materials, and thus leaving the perovskite crystal structure. This could explain the reports about the beneficial addition of acids in perovskite precursors solution, mainly by Snaith group \cite{Noel2017,Zhang2015a,Nayak2016}.


https://www.ossila.com/pages/perovskite-solar-cell-degradation-causes

	\paragraph{Diffusion as the main transport mechanism}(due to the built-in voltage being the workfunction difference of the selective contacts)(drift is not the main transport mechanism in stabilized perovskite solar cells due to the electric screening effect of the mobile ionic species)

	\paragraph{Recombination mechanisms} The radiative recombination in the perovskite material is surprisingly low as the diffusion length in an isolated crystal is large: for the \gls{csfamapbibr} it is reported being \SI{\approx140}{\nm} for the electrons and \SI{\approx1.9}{\um} for holes \cite{Liu2017}. This is confirmed by the fact that once a thin layer (\SI{\approx500}{\nm}) of the material is layered between an \gls{etm} and an \gls{htm} the photoluminescence lifetime gets dramatically reduced \cite{Jimenez-Lopez2017} indicating that the free charges can diffuse  at least over the layer thickness. Even if not universally accepted \cite{Valadez-Villalobos2019}, it is often reported that in open circuit conditions, the predominant recombination pathway in perovskite solar cells is identifiable in the surface recombination at the perovskite/selective contacts interfaces \cite{Calado2018b,Stolterfoht2018a,Stolterfoht2018}. This recombination is more important in a perovskite solar cell rather than in \gls{osc} as the built-in field is shielded by the ionic accumulation which causes a high minority carriers concentration at the perovskite/contacts interfaces.

	\paragraph{Characterization}
	The characterization techniques for perovskite solar cells and the relative interpretation evolved from the techniques and theory built around \gls{osc} and \gls{dssc}. This pre-existing framework has been widely used in literature for perovskite solar cells. Unfortunately, perovskite solar cells are different enough from \gls{osc} and \gls{dssc} to doom the utility of most of these observations. In the past few years, the theoretical framework has been expanded and should finally enable the perovskite community to re-interpret and re-design the solar cells characterization techniques. In \cref{ch:interpretation} the reader can find some of the accepted concepts and some novel proposals about the interpretation of the classical characterization techniques when used on perovskite solar cells.
