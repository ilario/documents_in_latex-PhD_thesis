	\subsection{Original Project}
		I received a proof-of-concept software developed by Daniel Fernandez Pinto and decided to continue the development. At that point the software had an interface with few buttons and a working Keithley communication library.

	\subsection{User's requests}
	\subsection{Implementation and user interface}

		\myparagraph{Autoscale} As it was explained in page~\pageref{autoscale}, the automatic scale setting of the Keithley is detrimental for perovskite solar cells dynamic measurements.

		\myparagraph{Auto-measure}\label{automeasure}
		
	\subsection{Limitations}
		
		The interface development has been started with the "Monkey Studio" software, which development has ceased even before the start of PyPV. This demonstrated to be a big failure in long term development planning.
