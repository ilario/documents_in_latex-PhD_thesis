	\subsection{Original Project}
		I received a proof-of-concept software developed by Daniel Fernandez Pinto and decided to continue the development. At that point the software had an interface with few buttons and a working Keithley communication library.

	\subsection{User's requests}

		Installation instructions
		Shutter control
		GPIB GPIB0
	\subsection{Implementation and user interface}

		\paragraph{Autoscale} As it was explained in \cpageref{autoscale}, the automatic scale setting of the Keithley is detrimental for perovskite solar cells dynamic measurements.

		\paragraph{Auto-measure}\label{automeasure}
		The devices are kept under illumination at open circuit conditions, then a reverse sweep is measured and, immediately after this, the forward sweep is measured.
		The reason for measuring the reverse sweep first, is that the reverse sweep starts from a high voltage point which is closer to the stabilized condition of the devices prior to the measurement (illuminated and open circuit).
		

		\paragraph{Resistances} The shunt and series resistances estimation from current-voltage sweeps have been implemented but should not be considered for measurements on hysteretic devices, as explained in \cpageref{resistances}.
		
		\paragraph{Scan speed calculation} 
		The scan speed $s[V/s]$ is obtained from the voltage step \texttt{:SENSe:VOLTage:STEP} $V_|step|[V]$, integration time \texttt{:SENSe:VOLTage:NPLCycles} $n_|int|$ measured in power line cycles and the delay time \texttt{:SOURce:DELay} $t_|delay|[s]$ Keithley's parameters with the following \textit{empirical} expression:
		
		\begin{equation}
		s = \frac{V_|step|}{0.003 + t_|delay| + 0.06 \cdot n_|int|}
		\end{equation}
		
		where $t_|delay|$ is \SI{1}{\ms} for our measurement conditions \cite{Keithley2011}.

	\subsection{Limitations}

		The interface development has been started with the "Monkey Studio" software, which development has ceased even before the start of PyPV. This demonstrated to be a big failure in long term development planning.
