	\epigraph{\textit{"Ok, I finally completed it, by the way, why did you start developing this?"\\"Well, it was just a proof of concept, but it's nice you worked on it"}}

	\subsection{Original Project}
		I received a proof-of-concept software developed by Daniel Fernandez Pinto and decided to continue the development. At that point the software had an interface with few buttons and a working Keithley communication library.

	\subsection{User's requests}

		Installation instructions
		Shutter control
		GPIB GPIB0
	\subsection{Implementation and user interface}

		\paragraph{Autoscale} As it was explained in \cpageref{autoscale}, the automatic scale setting of the Keithley is detrimental for perovskite solar cells dynamic measurements.

		\paragraph{Auto-measure}\label{automeasure}

		\paragraph{Resistances} The shunt and series resistances estimation from current-voltage sweeps have been implemented but should not be considered for measurements on hysteretic devices, as explained in \cpageref{resistances}.

	\subsection{Limitations}

		The interface development has been started with the "Monkey Studio" software, which development has ceased even before the start of PyPV. This demonstrated to be a big failure in long term development planning.
