Solvent annealing of contact Wu2016

Energy disorder Shao2016

HOMO shift measured by CE and DC has been correlated with UPS for OSC Credgington2014

Steepness of absorbance onset also indicates the presence/absence of mid-gap states in the HTM, whose presence would favour the surface recombination \cite{Tvingstedt2017}

Impact of dopants in HTM on voc \cite{Correa-Baena2017} "Therefore, dopants act as recombination centers at the HSL interface and dominate recombination dynamics over e.g. the energetics of the HTM which is secondary as shown in a recent study by Belisle et al.39"

"the often-questionable validity of vacuum level alignment, the importance of interface dipoles, and band bending as the result of interface formation" \cite{Schulz2019}
