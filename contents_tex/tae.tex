	\paragraph{Abstract} In perovskite solar cells, the absorber is usually sandwiched between two different contacts: the \gls{htm} and the \gls{etm} with the role of extracting respectively the holes and the electrons. Without this asymmetrical extraction of charges, the photogeneration would be of no use. The classical \gls{etm} from \gls{dssc}, mesoporous titania, is slowly getting replaced by planar tin oxide \cite{Jiang2018}. On the contrary, the classical \gls{htm} from solid-state \gls{dssc}, \gls{spiro}, is still present in most of the record structures. The huge explorative work done for finding a more performing \gls{htm} had some success with a few molecules and, for some cases, with \gls{ptaa}. In most of the cases, even if the performances are at par with \gls{spiro}, the price is still too high for wide area applications. A better understanding of the \gls{htm}/perovskite interaction is needed for pinpointing the key characteristics to be looked for in the next \gls{htm} design. In this chapter, the devices fabricated using four different \gls{htm} have been compared in order to find a correlation with the \gls{htm}'s chemical properties.

\paragraph{Publications} Part of this chapter has been published in \fullcite{Gelmetti2019}.

HOMO shift measured by CE and DC has been correlated with UPS for OSC Credgington2014

Steepness of absorbance onset also indicates the presence/absence of mid-gap states in the HTM, whose presence would favour the surface recombination \cite{Tvingstedt2017}
